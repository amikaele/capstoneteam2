        <p>Here at APU, we have had a tradition of several years of computer science senior capstone projects centered around APU's 	CubeSat endeavors.
	The computer science senior capstone projects are the culmination of a year's worth of planning and execution geared towards 	developing a marketable website or application. 
	Students are encouraged to explore building a product that interests them, and there is always a group that does work centered 	around APU's CubeSat program as we gear up towards a 
	launch.The first senior project based around our program was completed during the 2020-2021 school year.
	This group set out to build software that would become the foundation of how intermediate
	or amateur radio/spacecraft enjoyers show off their data.</p>
