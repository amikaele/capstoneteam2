	<h2>Overview</h2>
	
	
        <p>Here at APU, we have had a tradition of several years of computer science senior capstone projects centered around APU's CubeSat endeavors.
	The computer science senior capstone projects are the culmination of a year's worth of planning and execution geared towards developing a marketable website or application. 
	Students are encouraged to explore building a product that interests them, and there is always a group that does work centered around APU's CubeSat program as we gear up towards a 
	launch.

	<h3>Exploring What's Possible</h3>

	<p>This is the fourth year of APU CubeSat capstones! The first senior project based around our program was completed during the 	2020-2021 school year, and this page you are now reading is a result of the senior class of 2023-2024's own CubeSat capstone 	project.</p>
