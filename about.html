	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	
	
	<img src="about1.png" alt="Team Meeting">

        <p>CubeSats began as a collaborative effort in
	1999 between Jordi Puig-Suari, a professor at California
	Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly), and Bob Twiggs, a
	professor at Stanford University’s Space Systems Development
	Laboratory (SSDL). The original intent of the project was
	to provide affordable access to space for the university sci-
	ence community, and it has successfully done so. Thanks
	to CubeSats, many major universities now have a space
	program. But it’s not just big universities; smaller universities, 
	high schools, middle schools, and elementary schools
	have also been able to start CubeSat programs of their own.</p>

	<h2>NASA's CubeSat Launch Initiative</h2>
	<p>CSLI is a NASA initiative that provides opportunities
	for qualified CubeSats to fly as auxiliary payloads on future launches that have
	excess capacity or as deployments from the International Space Station (ISS). In
	very simple terms that means that NASA will cover the cost of providing your
	CubeSat a ride to space in exchange for a report on the results of your CubeSat
	investigation.
