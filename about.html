        <h4>CubeSats began as a collaborative effort in
	1999 between Jordi Puig-Suari, a professor at California
	Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly), and Bob Twiggs, a
	professor at Stanford University’s Space Systems Development
	Laboratory (SSDL). The original intent of the project was
	to provide affordable access to space for the university sci-
	ence community, and it has successfully done so. Thanks
	to CubeSats, many major universities now have a space
	program. But it’s not just big universities; smaller universities, 
	high schools, middle schools, and elementary schools
	have also been able to start CubeSat programs of their own.</h4>

	<h2>NASA's CubeSat Launch Initiative</h2>
	<p>CSLI is a NASA initiative that provides opportunities
	for qualified CubeSats to fly as auxiliary payloads on future launches that have
	excess capacity or as deployments from the International Space Station (ISS). In
	very simple terms that means that NASA will cover the cost of providing your
	CubeSat a ride to space in exchange for a report on the results of your CubeSat
	investigation.</p>
		
	<p>
	About half of all CSLI missions are conducting scientific investigations, most
	frequently Space Weather and Earth Science. Specific science investigation areas
	include: biological science, study of near Earth objects, climate change, snow/ice
	coverage, orbital debris, planetary science, space-based astronomy, and heliophysics. Sixty-six percent of all CSLI missions are conducting technology development or 	demonstrations. Communications, propulsion, navigation and control,
	and radiation testing lead the topics in this area. Other notable technologies are
	solar sails, additive manufacturing, femtosatellites, and smart phone satellites.
	The low cost of development for a CubeSat allows for conducting higher risk
	activities that would not be possible on large-scale NASA missions.

	<h2>CubeSat Designation</h2>

	<p>Let’s explain what the “CubeSat” designation means,
	compared to other small satellites. A small satellite is
	generally considered to be any satellite that weighs less
	than 300 kg (1,100 lb). A CubeSat, however, must conform to specific criteria that control factors such as its
	shape, size, and weight.</p>
		

	<p>The very specific standards for CubeSats help reduce
	costs. The standardized aspects of CubeSats make it
	possible for companies to mass-produce components
	and offer off-the-shelf parts. As a result, the engineering and development of CubeSats becomes less costly
	than highly customized small satellites. The standardized shape and size also reduces costs associated with
	transporting them to, and deploying them into, space.</p>


	<p>CubeSats come in several sizes, which are based on the
	standard CubeSat “unit”—referred to as a 1U. A 1U
	CubeSat is a 10 cm cube with a mass of approximately
	1 to 1.33 kg. In the years since the CubeSat’s inception, 
	larger sizes have become popular, such as the 1.5U, 2U, 3U, 6U, and 12U.</p>

	<h2>Launch Vehicles</h2>
	<p>Let’s talk about how the dispenser which contains your CubeSat will get
	into orbit. CSLI contracts with multiple launch services that allow CubeSats to
	hitch a ride. When the CubeSat/dispenser package was first dreamed up, the
	idea was to bolt the dispenser onto the rocket where space was available. That is
	still how most CubeSats make the journey, although there are now other options 
	available. For example, a CubeSat can be sent with
	the cargo on a resupply mission to the Space Station. The CubeSat
	would be taken aboard the Space Station and released into space in
	a specially designed deployer.</p>

	<img src="about4.png" alt="CubeSat Launches">
	
	<p>You also may forgo the dispenser altogether, like the Peruvian
	Chasqui 1 did in 2014. During a spacewalk, a cosmonaut released
	Chasqui 1 from the Space Station by tossing it by hand into orbit.
	There’s even a video of this online! FIGURE 6 is a still from that video.
	Keep in mind that although it has been done, this type of release is
	extremely uncommon.</p>
